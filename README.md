# Ari-Internal-Narrative
Internal Thought Project for Ari
Narrative System Prototype

This is a work in progress for a continuous internal narrative system.
It includes:
 - A MemoryManager that handles short-term, mid-term, and long-term memories.
 - A NarrativeSystem that processes user input, logs conversations, and performs
   periodic self-reflection (narrative drift).
 - A dummy model function to simulate response generation.
 - Generating spontaneous, non-repetitive drift responses using random templates.*
 - Referencing previous drift reflections to build continuity.
 - Adding emotional and conceptual self-tagging.
 - Generating new internal questions to push reflective thought.

Future improvements may include:
 - Integration with an actual language model.
 - More sophisticated memory compression and retrieval.
 - Advanced scheduling and dynamic context management.
 - *Will intergrate a better system for tracking drift responses and emotional tags
